# LACS Implementation

Final project of Computer Architecture (Spring 2016) by [Yinhang Tang](https://github.com/tyh1995) and [Jiyuan Liu](https://github.com/MrWhoami).

## Introduction 

LACS is a last level cache replacement algorithm for last-level cache (LLC). LACS is the abbreviation for "locality-aware cost-sensitive". The basic idea of this algotithm is:

> "Not All Misses are Created Equal". 

So, we should take the different miss penalty into consideration while replacing the cache blocks instead of only considering the miss rate.

This project is an implementation of the LACS LLC replacement algorithm. We base our project on SimpleScalar.
